# functest-custom-docker
Extension of Dockerfile from opnfv/functest with personal customizations

When working with OPNFV, it is common to develop the code directly from inside
the containers, as it contains all the surrounding dependencies for the
projects. However, I am used to some tools and configuration files that make
coding much easier.
